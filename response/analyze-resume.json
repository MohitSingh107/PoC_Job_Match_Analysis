    "experience_reasoning": "The candidate has no explicit work experience in Data Analytics roles. The only relevant experience is an ongoing Instrument and Controls Engineer role since Nov 2020, which is not directly Data Analytics. Trainings and projects related to Machine Learning and Python are present but no explicit DA job experience. Hence, experience duration in DA is effectively 0 years, classifying as Fresher.",
